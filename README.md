# Thyroid Disease Diagnosis Tool with Explainable AI

## Overview

This project is a highly accurate diagnosis tool for thyroid disease, utilizing XGBoost and ensemble learning techniques. The model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.6%. Additionally, the project integrates Explainable AI (XAI) to provide transparent insights into the decision-making process, aiding in understanding symptoms and potential causes of thyroid disease.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes XGBoost and ensemble learning to achieve 99.6% accuracy in diagnosing thyroid disease.
- **Explainable AI**: Incorporates XAI to make the model's decisions interpretable, helping healthcare professionals understand the reasoning behind predictions.
- **Data Collection**: Collaborated with healthcare professionals and collected data through Google Forms to enhance model accuracy and reliability.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and CanvasJS for dynamic, real-time simulations and an intuitive user experience.

## Model Explanation

The diagnosis tool employs the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data collected from healthcare professionals.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features for training the model.
3. **Model Training**: Uses XGBoost and ensemble learning techniques to train the model.
4. **Explainability**: Implements Explainable AI to provide transparency in the model's predictions, helping users understand the factors contributing to each diagnosis.

## Data Collection

Data was collected through Google Forms, with inputs from doctors and healthcare professionals. This collaborative approach ensured that the model was trained on accurate and relevant data, improving its reliability and accuracy.

## Acknowledgements

- **Healthcare Professionals**: For their valuable insights and data contributions.
- **XGBoost and CanvasJS Communities**: For providing powerful tools and resources.
